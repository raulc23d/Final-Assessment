ELDERLY & ICT 
There could be several reasons why some elderly individuals may be hesitant to accept or fully embrace Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT). It's essential to note that not all elderly individuals are resistant to technology, and there is a wide range of attitudes and experiences within this 
demographic. However, some common factors contributing to their reluctance include:
 
Lack of exposure. Many elderly individuals did not grow up with technology as it is today, and they might not have had the same opportunities to 
learn and adapt to new technologies as younger generations. 
Fear of complexity. ICT devices and applications can be intimidating to those who are not familiar with them. The fear of breaking something or 
getting overwhelmed by the complexities of technology can deter them from trying. 
Physical barriers. Some elderly individuals may have physical limitations, such as poor eyesight or limited dexterity, which can make it challenging to 
use modern digital devices. 
Cost. Technology can be expensive, and some elderly individuals may be on fixed incomes, making it difficult to invest in gadgets and internet services. 
Lack of relevance. If an elderly person does not see the immediate need or practical benefits of using ICT, they may be less motivated to adopt it. 
Privacy and security concerns. Older individuals may be more cautious about sharing personal information online due to concerns about privacy and 
security breaches. 
Digital divide. The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not. Some elderly individuals may 
not have access to the necessary devices or internet connections. 
Generational gap. The generational gap can sometimes lead to a cultural disconnect between younger tech-savvy individuals and older adults who 
may feel overwhelmed or dismissed when seeking help. 
Overcoming these barriers involves a combination of efforts, such as providing user-friendly technology, offering training and support tailored to older 
adults, addressing privacy and security concerns, and fostering an inclusive and understanding environment where seniors feel encouraged to explore and 
learn at their pace. It's essential to remember that many elderly individuals do embrace technology and use it effectively for communication, learning, and 
entertainment. Each person's attitude toward technology is unique and may depend on their individual experiences and circumstances. 
Overcoming each of mentioned factors2 
1. Lack of exposure: 
Organize technology workshops and training sessions specifically designed for older adults, where they can learn at their own pace and in a 
comfortable environment. 
Encourage family members or friends to spend time with them, patiently introducing them to various technologies and showing them how to 
use them. 
2. Fear of complexity: 
Start with simple and user-friendly devices and applications, gradually introducing more advanced ones as they become more comfortable. 
Provide clear and concise written or video instructions on how to use various technologies, focusing on practical applications relevant to their 
daily lives. 
3. Physical barriers: 
Consider accessibility features and adaptive devices to make technology more user-friendly for those with physical limitations (e.g., larger text 
size, voice commands, or touch-screen options). 
Offer support and patience during the learning process, understanding that it may take some time for them to adapt. 
4. Cost: 
Explore options for affordable or subsidized technology and internet services for seniors, such as special discounts or programs offered by local 
governments or non-profit organizations. 
 Consider introducing them to cost-effective devices, such as budget-friendly smartphones or tablets. 
5. Lack of relevance: 
Showcase the practical benefits of using technology, such as video calls to stay connected with family members who live far away or online 
shopping to have groceries delivered. 
Find applications or tools that align with their interests or hobbies, making the technology more engaging and relevant to their lives. 
6. Privacy and security concerns: 
Educate them about best practices for online safety and privacy protection. 
Help them set up strong and secure passwords and enable two-factor authentication for added security. 
Introduce them to reliable and reputable websites and applications to minimize the risk of scams or phishing attempts. 
7. Digital divide: 
Advocate for improved access to technology and internet services for seniors, especially in rural or low-income areas. 
Local community centers or libraries can offer free internet access and computer resources for seniors to get started with technology. 
8. Generational gap: 
Foster a supportive and patient environment where seniors feel comfortable asking questions without fear of judgment. 
Encourage intergenerational interactions, such as pairing tech-savvy youth with elderly individuals for technology mentoring and learning. 
Overall, the key is to be patient, understanding, and compassionate while guiding elderly individuals through their technology adoption journey. Recognize 
that everyone learns at their own pace, and the process may take time, but with consistent support and encouragement, they can gradually become more 
comfortable and proficient with ICT.
